## GameSelected: CyberBlitz by the Chicken and Waffle Group
The fall 2017 GAME2359 GameSim group known as The Waffle Group has created a 1 to 4 player game based on the game of Dodge Ball.  This game targets the casual to intermediate gamer and depicts a futuristic game of Dodge Ball in one of three arenas.

The player or players control a selected 'bot' to get a ball, retreat to the attack area and throw the ball at the opponent.  Avatars in the game not controlloed by the user or users will get controlled by the computer (AI).  The player or players can select from one of four avatars on either the Red team or the Blue team.  The player can chose either Bao - a Panda playing bot, Cole a more traditional bot, Maya or Girl bot and Unit-Y a bat playing bot.  The players can cose to play with one, all or any combination of the following balls: Neon Ball the default ball, fastest and simplist, the Bomb Ball slower but will explode "killing all the opposition" in an area, the Freeze Ball that stops the opposition in an area for a shorttime, the Asian Ball that splits into two balls (Ying and Yang) and the homing ball that will chase players.  The chosen balls will get 'spawned' randomly in the center of the court to replace thrown balls used in game play.

Play will take place on one of three courts: Neon Arena futuristic arena somewhat like Tron, Crystal Cave ina a cave with large crystals and other cave objects and Asian Arena a futureinstic Dojo that flies over a future asian city.

We chose this game for the following resons: it meets the criteria of not too violent, not mainstream and preferbaly still in test stages.  This game has too Play test sessoins but I would not say we have reached a fully functionsg game.  We feel we can provide a service to the GameSim people with our play testing and test the game as in gets better developed.

In the intrest of full disclosure two members of this team B. Heath and T. Womack have an association with The Waffle Group, B. Heath as an Art Lead and Product Owner and T. Womack as the Programmer lead.  G. Broughton remains independent.
